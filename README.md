# Time-Series-Analysis--Weather

This is an exploratory exercise to get familiar with data cleaning, visualization, and modeling in python. The data provided is from UCI Underground API, measuring weather characteristics over time in Delhi, India. These characteristics include humidity, mean temperature, wind speed, and mean pressure. I utilized python and its libraries to examine the data, provide several plots, and carry out a linear regression model at the end. There is a brief report at the end discussing general trends in the data, along with a one sentence reflection. 

The purpose of this exercise is to ultimately serve as a foundation for future projects in statistics and data analytics.

Enjoy!
